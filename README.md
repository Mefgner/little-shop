### Vue and Express e-commerce project i wrote as a pet one.
### Also were used vue-router and pinia; MySQL; Stripe; JWT Auth.

Writing this project i've learned a lot of things such a 
Composition API use, using composables, routing, token based protection, stripe webhooks, 
static file manipulation, REST, bd migrations, using separated environments and etc...

## How to run it?
 - You need to have a mysql server (mariaDB), and set to .env auth settings.
 - Stripe cli or stripe global webhook registration.
 - Install packages: in each folder(client, server) type `npm install`
 - Then just `.\run.ps1` in your powershell console.
